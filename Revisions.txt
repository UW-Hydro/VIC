--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r4Rdd to VIC 4.1.0 beta r4ee **
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes in EXCESS_ICE calculations

         Files affected:

         full_energy.c 
         vicNl_def.h

         Description:

         Added MAX_SUBSIDENCE parameter to EXCESS_ICE option. 
         Fixed bug in subsidence calculation. 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r4cc to VIC 4.1.0 beta r4dd **
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Incorrect limits on soil layer evap in runoff() for SPATIAL_FROST = TRUE

         Files affected:

         runoff.c
 
         Description:

         Modified to correctly handle evaporation from spatially
         distributed soil frost.  Original version could produce
         negative soil moisture in fractions with high ice content
         since only total evaporation was checked versus total
         liquid water content, not versus available liquid water
         in each frost subsection.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r4bb to VIC 4.1.0 beta r4cc ** 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moved check for soil moisture > max to initialize_model_state.c

         Files affected:

         read_initial_model_state.c
         initialize_model_state.c

         Description:

         For initializing the model state the check for soil
         moist > max moist was moved from read_initial_model_state.c
         to initialize_model_state.c. The check is performed on all veg types
         even if the area fraction = 0. There was a situation with
         EXCESS_ICE = TRUE when the model was trying to distribute
         moisture values that exceeded max moist to each thermal node
         in the wetland area when Cl = 0.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r4aa to VIC 4.1.0 beta r4bb ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Handling of cells missing from snowband file

         Files affected:

         read_snowband.c

         Description:

         Previously, if SNOW_BAND = TRUE and a particular cell was not listed
         in the snowband file, VIC would abort.  Now, when VIC encounters
         cells with no information in the snowband file, VIC issues a warning
         and sets the cells to have 1 band, with Tfactor = 0 and Pfactor = 1.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r4z to VIC 4.1.0 beta r4aa ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Memory errors for ARC_SOIL=TRUE and OUTPUT_FORCE=TRUE

            Files Affected:

            get_force_type.c
            get_global_param.c
            initialize_global.c
            read_soilparam.c
            read_soilparam_arc.c
            vicNl.c

            Description:

            Memory errors would occur when ARC_SOIL=TRUE and
            OUTPUT_FORCE=TRUE.
            In addition, the output files would not contain sufficient
            contents due to not closing properly.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r4y to VIC 4.1.0 beta r4z ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed bug for read-in during EXCESS_ICE option.

            Files affected:

            read_initial_model_state.c

            Fixed bug for read-in during EXCESS_ICE option.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r4x to VIC 4.1.0 beta r4y ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Trap cases of negative soil moisture. 

            Files affected:

            full_energy.c

            No longer resets ice content to previous time-step ice content if
            subsidence has occurred.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 **** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r4w to VIC 4.1.0 beta r4x ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Trap cases of T-errors matching variable ERROR for root_brent.

            Files affected:

            calc_atmos_energy_bal.c
            calc_surf_energy_bal.c
            frozen_soil.c
            ice_melt.c
            root_brent.c
            snow_intercept.c
            snow_melt.c


            Basically, what was happening was that when root_brent was called
            from calc_surf_energy_bal with func_surf_energy_bal as Function,
            then func_surf_energy_bal was ocasionally returning a value of
            ERROR to
            root_brent, and root_brent was then (in some cases) interpreting
            this as an actual surface temperature and continuing merrily on
            its way. So, there was an error in the model that was never
            caught. So, now root_brent checks for this and returns a value of
            ERROR if there is a problem. Because of this change, all of the
            routines that call root_brent had to be changed since they checked
            against an error of -9998 - now they check for
            values less than -998, since ERROR = -999.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r4v to VIC 4.1.0 beta r4w ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Drop canopy snow if thin

     Files Affected:

     snow_intercept.c

     Description:

     Modified to drop canopy snow if it is especially thin
     (< MIN_SWQ_EB_THRES), which should improve the numeric
     stability of the canopy energy balance solution.  KAC via TJB




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r4u to VIC 4.1.0 beta r4v ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Bare soil evap for LAI=0

      Files affected:

      func_surf_energy_bal.c

      Description:

      Modified to use arno_evap rather than canopy_evap if LAI
      is 0, e.g. winter cropland.  KAC via TJB



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r4t to VIC 4.1.0 beta r4u ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Added EXCESS_ICE option (set in user_def.h)

        Files affected:
        calc_surf_energy_bal.c
        calc_water_energy_balance_errors.c
        display_current_settings.c
        frozen_soil.c

        output_list_utils.c
        prepare_full_energy.c
        put_data.c
        read_initial_model_state.c
        read_soilparam_arc.c
        read_soilparam.c
        runoff.c
        soil_conduction.c
        soil_thermal_eqn.c
        surface_fluxes.c
        user_def.h
        vicNl.c
        vicNl_def.h
        vicNl.h
        wetland_energy.c
        write_model_state.c

        Description:
        If TRUE, VIC allows for excess ground ice, i.e. an expanded porosity
        to account for an initial volumetric ice fraction larger than
        soil porosity.  The ground subsides (therefore soil depth is no
        longer static) and the porosity decreases as the excess ice melts.
        Once porosity reaches the soil porosity (1-bulk density/soil density),
        it does not change.  The initial volumetric ice fraction for
        each soil layer must be defined in the soil file. The maximum value
        for this initial ice fraction is set by MAX_ICE_INIT in
        vicNl_def.h.  Another new parameter is ICE_AT_SUBSIDENCE, also set
        in vicNl_def.h.  This parameter controls the rate of subsidence as
        the ground warms.  Setting a larger value will cause the ground to
        subside sooner and faster.  The physical bounds of this parameter
        are 0.0 and 1.0, although setting this to a value of 1.0 will result
        in the ground continually subsiding despite very cold soil
        temperatures because there is always a small amount of unfrozen water
        in each soil layer due to the function used in maximum_unfrozen_water.
        The recommended value is 0.8.





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r4s to VIC 4.1.0 beta r4t ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Added ErrorFlag return value from initialize_prcp.

          Files affected:

          lakes.eb.c
          LAKE.h

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r4r to VIC 4.1.0 beta r4s ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moved ARNO/NIJSSEN conversion after calculation of max_moist.

          Files affected:

          read_soilparam_arc.c


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r4q to VIC 4.1.0 beta r4r ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moved Implicit error counting above call for solve_T_profile.

          Files affected:

          func_surf_energy_bal

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r4p to VIC 4.1.0 beta r4q ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sub-daily snow step for 24h wb mode not aggregating correctly

           Files affected:

           snow_melt.c (melt units corrected to mm)
           solve_snow.c (melt units corrected to mm)
           surface_fluxes.c (iter_* and step_* structures)

           Description:

           The implementation of the canopy iteration in surface_fluxes()
           caused the data structures containing the results
           for the sub-daily snow steps to be reset at the beginning
           of every sub-daily step, resulting in large water
           balance errors and incorrect daily results.  This has been fixed by
           creating distinct data structures to store results for
           iterations (iter_*) and steps (step_*).  In addition,
           the units of snow melt were corrected to
           be consistent (mm) across functions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r4o to VIC 4.1.0 beta r4p ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bug fix for previous bug fix to dt_baseflow calculation.

           Files Affected:

           runoff.c

           Description:

           Fixed bug arising from earlier fix to dt_baseflow
           calculation.  Earlier fix took residual moisture
           into account in the linear part of the baseflow eqn,
           but not in the non-linear part.  Now we take residual
           moisture into account correctly throughout the whole
           equation.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r4n to VIC 4.1.0 beta r4o ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Checks for missing fields in soil param file

           Files affected:

           read_soilparam.c

           Description: Mismatches between the global file and the soil param
           file were leading to bogus error messages. read_soilparam now
           checks to see if fields are available. Changed 'fscanf' to 'sscanf'
           statements to prevent incorrectly reading beyond the end-of-line.
           GCT



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r4m to VIC 4.1.0 beta r4n ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Checks for correct number of fields in vegparam file

           Files affected:

           read_vegparam.c

           Description: Mismatches between the global file and the veg param
           file were leading to bogus error messages. read_vegparam now checks
           for correct number of root zones, blowing parameters, and 
           LAI values and provides (hopefully) more useful error statements. GCT

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r4l to VIC 4.1.0 beta r4m ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Exponential grid transformation option for soil thermal nodes in finite different heat equation

            Files affected:
            calc_surf_energy_bal.c
            display_current_settings.c
            frozen_soil.c
            func_surf_energy_bal.c
            get_global_param.c
            initialize_global.c
            initialize_model_state.c
            soil_conduction.c
            soil_thermal_eqn.c
            vicNl_def.h

            Description: New option is now EXP_TRANS to have an exponential distribution
            of the thermal node depths in the vertical dimension.  This allows for closer
            thermal nodes near the surface of soil where the variance is greatest.  The
            transformation allows for the solution to be solved in linear-space,
            wherein the nodes are distributed linearly with depth, but the physical
            system exists in exponential space.  This change also involves a
            rearranging of the terms in the finite-difference equaton (equation 8
            of Cherkauer et al. 1999).  Therefore the constants (A-E) are calculated in a new
            way.  These constants are equal to the constants in each of the terms in equation 8
            multiplied by alpha^2*deltat.


Implicit solution option for finite difference frozen soils algorithm

            Files affected:
            calc_surf_energy_bal.c
            display_current_settings.c
            frozen_soil.c
            func_surf_energy_bal.c
            get_global_param.c
            initialize_global.c
            Makefile
            surface_fluxes.c
            vicNl_def.h
            vicNl.h

            Description: The implicit solution uses Newton Raphson to solve the system of
            non-linear equations.  Therefore there is a new option, IMPLICIT.  If the
            implicit solution fails (which can sometimes occur at the initial formation
            of ice in the soil column), the model will use the original explicit solver
            to solve for the thermal temperatures for that time-step only.  The implicit
            option is unconditionally stable and therefore the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition
            does not need to be checked (as it should be for the explicit solver).


Zsum_node calculated once and passed in soil_con to other subroutines

          Files affected:
          calc_surf_energy_bal.c
          func_surf_energy_bal.c
          initialize_model_state.c
          lakes.eb.c
          read_initial_model_state.c
          runoff.c
          soil_conduction.c
          vicNl_def.h
          write_debug.c
          write_model_state.c

          Description:  Zsum_node is the depth of each of the thermal nodes needed
          for the finite difference frozen soils algorithm.  Rather than re-calculating
          this value in various places, this vector is now passed in the soil_con
          structure to the various subroutines where it is needed.  The one
          exception is set_node_parameters, because this is a slightly different
          definition of Zsum.


Patch for "cold nose" problem

      Files affected:
      frozen_soil.c
      soil_thermal_eqn.c

      Description:
      This is an inelegant fix for "cold nose" problem that may occur in
      the finite different frozen soil algorithm in each mode of operation.
      This involves a thermal node that is of a lower temperature than the
      upper and lower thermal nodes.  Due to the first term of the heat
      conduction term (the term that accounts for a change in the thermal
      conductivity in space), the first term can become more negative
      than the second term. This causes this cold node to become
      much colder and thus breaks the second law of thermodynamics (because
      flux_term1 exceeds flux_term2 in absolute magnitude).  Therefore, a check
      is now made to set the first term to zero when this begins to happen.
      This only seems to happen in the first and second near-surface nodes.



BUG FIXES:

Read in order incorrect in error_print_surf_energy_bal

     Files affected:
     calc_surf_energy_bal.c


Removed (1.-snow_coverage) from three equations where it did not belong

        Files affected:
        func_surf_energy_bal.c


OTHER MODIFICATIONS:

setup_frozen_soil subroutine removed as it is never called

                   Files affected:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r4k to VIC 4.1.0 beta r4l ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed fread statements

        Files affected:

        read_initial_model_state.c

        Fixed fread checks to make sure correct number of items were read
        in rather than the size of the item read in.  JCA

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r4j to VIC 4.1.0 beta r4k ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changed comment in description of c in vicNl_def.h  

        Files affected:

        vicNl_def.h

        Changed comment from "exponent" to "exponent in ARNO baseflow scheme"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r4h to VIC 4.1.0 beta r4i ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Added case of SPATIAL_FROST = TRUE in full_energy.c

        Files affected:

        full_energy.c

        This module needed to handle the case of SPATIAL_FROST = TRUE. GCT

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r4g to VIC 4.1.0 beta r4h *****
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Added global option CONTINUEONERROR allowing simulation to continue on cell error.

        Files affected:

        arno_evap.c
        CalcAerodynamic.c
        calc_atmos_energy_bal.c

        global.param.sample
        LAKE.h
        vicNl_def.h
        vicNl.h

        If the global option CONTINUEONERROR is set to TRUE then the
        simulation continues to run even if a cell fails and produces
        partial output. Default is is for CONTINUEONERROR to be FALSE,
        as in previous versions of model. The return value of some modules
        was changed from void to an int numeric return value. The ERROR value is
        defined in vicNl_def.h.

***** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r4f to VIC 4.1.0 beta r4g *****
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Aggregation methods of some variables not set properly.

        Files affected:

        output_list_utils.c

        Description:

        Corrected AGG_TYPE definitions for miscellaneous
        output variables; re-organized the code to make
        it easier to debug.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r4e to VIC 4.1.0 beta r4f *****
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If() statements in get_force_type() fail for some global parameter files

        Files Affected:

        get_force_type.c

        Description:

        Removed all of the if statements
          if(param_set.FORCE_FORMAT[file_num]==BINARY)
        since this ended up requiring that the "FORCE_FORMAT BINARY"
        line appear in the global parameter file before the list of
        forcing variables in order to work.  Since the sscanf()
        performs proper parsing regardless of ASCII (which doesn't
        have SIGNED or MULTIPLIER fields) vs. BINARY, we have removed
        the if() statements altogether.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r4d to VIC 4.1.0 beta r4e *****
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        write_header.c (new)

        Description:

        Added the PRT_HEADER option to the global parameter file.  If
        this is set to TRUE, VIC will insert a short header into its
        output files, describing the time step, start date/time,
        variables and units included in the file.

        For ascii files, the output header has the following format:

                # NRECS: (nrecs)
                # DT: (dt)
                # STARTDATE: yyyy-mm-dd hh:00:00
                # ALMA_OUTPUT: (0 or 1)
                # NVARS: (Nvars)
                # VARNAME    VARNAME   VARNAME   ...

        where
           nrecs       = Number of records in the file
           dt          = Time step length in hours
           start date  = Date and time of first record of file
           ALMA_OUTPUT = Indicates units of the variables; 0 = standard VIC
                         units; 1 = ALMA units
           Nvars       = Number of variables in the file, including date
                         fields

        For binary files, the output header has the following format:

            // Data        Stored As           Comment
            //
            // Identifier  (unsigned short)*4  0xFFFF, repeated 4 times
            // Nbytes      (unsigned short)*1  Number of bytes in the header,
            //                                 INCLUDING THE IDENTIFIER
            //
            // Part 1: Global Attributes
            // Nbytes1     (unsigned short)*1  Number of bytes in part 1
            // nrecs       (int)*1             Number of records in the file
            // dt          (int)*1             Time step length in hours
            // startyear   (int)*1             Year of first record
            // startmonth  (int)*1             Month of first record
            // startday    (int)*1             Day of first record
            // starthour   (int)*1             Hour of first record
            // ALMA_OUTPUT (char)*1            0 = standard VIC units; 1 = ALMA units
            // Nvars       (char)*1            Number of variables in the file,
            // including date fields
            //
            // Part 2: Variables
            // Nbytes2     (unsigned short)*1  Number of bytes in part 2
            // For each variable, the following fields: { len varname type mult }
            //   len       (char)*1            Number of characters in varname
            //   varname   (char)*len          Variable name
            //   type      (char)*1            Code identifying variable type
            //   mult      (float)*1           Multiplier for variable


        To accomodate input forcing files that might have been produced via
        VIC's OUTPUT_FORCE option, and therefore could contain a header,
        read_atmos_data.c has been modified to detect and skip headers that
        follow the formats outlined above.



Variable TYPE specifications for binary-format output files in the global parameter
file must match the strings listed in vicNl_def.h.

        Files affected:

        parse_output_info.c

        Description:

        When listing output variables in the global parameter file, if the
        output file format is binary, the variable data TYPE must match the string
        from vicNl_def.h exactly, e.g. "OUT_TYPE_INT" rather than just "INT".

More complete set of supported input variables

        Files affected:

        display_current_settings.c
        get_force_type.c
        get_force_type_pilps.c (removed)
        get_global_param.c
        initialize_atmos.c
        initialize_atmos_pilps.c (removed)
        initialize_global.c
        vicNl_def.h

        Description:

        Added REL_HUMID (relative humidity, as a fraction) to the list of
        supported met input variables.  Added the ALMA_INPUT option, which
        causes temperatures to be interpreted as Kelvin, pressures as kPa,
        and moisture fluxes as rates (mm/s) instead of accumulated fluxes
        (mm/timestep).  This allowed us to remove TAIR and PSURF from the
        list of supported met input variables, since AIR_TEMP and PRESSURE
        provide this ability when ALMA_INPUT is TRUE.  This also makes
        input variable specification more consistent with output variable
        specification.
        Since now the forcing files from PILPS can be read via the
        appropriate specification of input variables and ALMA_INPUT option
        in the global parameter file, the file initialize_atmos_pilps.c
        has been removed.


Atmos_data arrays are always allocated dynamically now.

        Files affected:

        alloc_atmos.c
        vicNl_def.h

        Description:

        Under some circumstances (OPTIMIZE and LINK_DEBUG options),
        the arrays in the atmos_data structure were hard-wired to have
        25 elements (large enough to store 24 hourly values and 1 daily
        value).  This wasted memory and has been abandoned.  Now, the
        arrays in atmos_data are always allocated dynamically to be only
        big enough to store exactly the number of necessary elements.

Changed OUT_SURF_TEMP from the average of T[0] and T[1] to exactly
equal to T[0].

        Files affected:

        put_data.c

        Description:

        Previously, OUT_SURF_TEMP had been set to the average of node
        temperatures T[0] and T[1].  This has been changed to just T[0],
        since OUT_SURF_TEMP represents the surface skin temperature.


More intuitive iteration loop variables in surface_fluxes().

        Files affected:

        surface_fluxes.c

        Description:

        Previously, for the non-SNOWSTEP case, step_inc and endhidx
        were set to gp->dt and hidx+gp->dt, respectively.  This was
        both unnecessary and confusing, since these assignments mixed
        dimensions.  Now, for the non-SNOWSTEP case, step_inc and endhidx
        have been changed to 1 and hidx+step_inc, respectively.

        Description:

        In earlier versions of VIC, the set of output files and their contents
        were hard-coded.  A few settings in user_def.h (OPTIMIZE and
	LDAS_OUTPUT) allowed the user to change the contents of the output
	files, but this has not been enough to accomodate the various needs of
	users.  Users inevitably have had to modify write_data.c to produce the
	type of output they want, and when VIC is updated, they must merge their
	changes into the new version of the code.

        VIC 4.1.0 now allows the user to specify exactly which output files to
        create and which variables to store in each file.  This way, users can
        save space by only writing those variables that are useful, and will
	be less likely to need to maintain a private version of the code to do
	this.

	In addition, VIC 4.1.0 can now aggregate the output variables to a
	user-defined output interval, via the OUT_STEP setting in the global
	parameter file.  Currently, the largest output interval allowed is 24
	hours, so this option is only useful for simulations running at sub-
	daily time steps.


        Main points:

        1. Output file names and contents can be specified in the global param
           file (see below).

        2. If you do not specify file names and contents in the global param
           file, VIC will produce the same set of output files that it has
           produced in earlier versions, namely "fluxes" and "snow" files,
	   plus "fdepth" files if FROZEN_SOIL is TRUE and "snowband" files if
           PRT_SNOW_BAND is TRUE.  These files will have the same contents and
           format as in earlier versions.

        3. The OPTIMIZE and LDAS_OUTPUT options have been removed.  These
           output configurations can be selected with the proper set of
           instructions in the global param file.  (see the output.*.template
           files included in this distribution for more information.)

        4. If you do specify the file names and contents in the global param
	   file, PRT_SNOW_BAND will have no effect.

        To specify file names and contents in the global param file, one
        should use the following format:

          (typical global param file contents here...)

          # Output File Contents
          N_OUTFILES    <n_outfiles>

          OUTFILE       <prefix>        <nvars>
          OUTVAR        <varname>       [<format>       <type>  <multiplier>]
          OUTVAR        <varname>       [<format>       <type>  <multiplier>]
          OUTVAR        <varname>       [<format>       <type>  <multiplier>]

          OUTFILE       <prefix>        <nvars>
          OUTVAR        <varname>       [<format>       <type>  <multiplier>]
          OUTVAR        <varname>       [<format>       <type>  <multiplier>]
          OUTVAR        <varname>       [<format>       <type>  <multiplier>]

        where
                <n_outfiles> = number of output files
                <prefix>     = name of the output file, NOT including latitude
                               and longitude
                <nvars>      = number of variables in the output file
                <varname>    = name of the variable (this must be one of the
                               output variable names listed in vicNl_def.h.)

                <format>, <type>, and <multiplier> are optional.  For a given
                variable, you can specify either NONE of these, or ALL of
                these.  If these are omitted, the default values will be used.

                <format>     = (for ascii output files) fprintf format string,
                               e.g.
                                 %.4f = floating point with 4 decimal places
                                 %.7e = scientific notation w/ 7 decimal
                                 %places
                                 *    = use the default format for this
                                 *    variable
                <type>       = (for binary output files) data type code.
                               Must be one of:
                                 OUT_TYPE_DOUBLE = double-precision floating
						   point
                                 OUT_TYPE_FLOAT  = single-precision floating
						   point
                                 OUT_TYPE_INT    = integer
                                 OUT_TYPE_USINT  = unsigned short integer
                                 OUT_TYPE_SINT   = short integer
                                 OUT_TYPE_CHAR   = char
                                 *               = use the default type
                <multiplier> = (for binary output files) factor to multiply
                               the data by before writing, to increase
                               precision.
                                 *    = use the default multiplier for this
                                 *    variable

        Here's an example.  To specify 2 output files, named "wbal" and
        "ebal", and containing water balance and energy balance terms,
        respectively, you could do something like this:

          N_OUTFILES    2

          OUTFILE       wbal    6
          OUTVAR        OUT_PREC
          OUTVAR        OUT_EVAP
          OUTVAR        OUT_RUNOFF
          OUTVAR        OUT_BASEFLOW
          OUTVAR        OUT_SWE
          OUTVAR        OUT_SOIL_MOIST

          OUTFILE       ebal    7
          OUTVAR        OUT_NET_SHORT
          OUTVAR        OUT_NET_LONG
          OUTVAR        OUT_LATENT
          OUTVAR        OUT_SENSIBLE
          OUTVAR        OUT_GRND_FLUX
          OUTVAR        OUT_SNOW_FLUX
          OUTVAR        OUT_ALBEDO

        Since no format, type, or multiplier were specified for any variables,
	VIC will use the default format, type, and multiplier for the variables.

        If you wanted scientific notation with 10 significant digits for
	ALBEDO, you could do the following:

          OUTVAR        OUT_ALBEDO              %.9e    *       *

        Note that even if you only want to specify the format, you must supply
	a value in the type and multiplier columns as well.  This can be "*" to
	indicate the default value.  Similarly, if you only want to specify the
	type (e.g.  as a double), you would need to do something like:

          OUTVAR        OUT_ALBEDO              *       OUT_TYPE_DOUBLE	*


        Date variables:

        For typical output files, the date is always written at the beginning
	of each record.  This will consist of the following columns:
          year month day hour
        For daily output timestep, "hour" is not written.

        If BINARY_OUTPUT is TRUE, these will all be written as type int
	(OUT_TYPE_INT).

        If OUTPUT_FORCE is TRUE, the date will NOT be written.


        Multiple-valued variables:

        Since variables like SOIL_MOIST have 1 value per soil layer, these
	variables will be written to multiple columns in the output file, one
	column per soil layer.  Other multiple-valued variables are treated
	similarly.


        Snow band output:

        To specify writing the values of variables in each snow band,  append
        "_BAND" to the variable name (this only works for some variables - see
        the list in vicNl_def.h).  If you specify these variables, the value
	of the variable in each band will be written, one band per column.  For
        example, for a cell having 2 snow bands:

          OUTVAR        OUT_SWE_BAND
          OUTVAR        OUT_ALBEDO_BAND

        will result in an output file containing:

          year month day (hour) swe[0] swe[1] albedo[0] albedo[1]

	Description:

	From a functional standpoint, the LAKE_MODEL compile-time option was
	redundant with the options.LAKE switch.  Meanwhile, the difference in
	the size of the executable between when the LAKE_MODEL switch was on
	or off was deemed insignificant.  Therefore, this switch was removed
	in the interest of making the code easier to maintain and reducing
	user confusion.  Now, to turn off lake functionality, simply set LAKE
	to FALSE in the global parameter file (or omit the "LAKE" line
	completely).

Uninitialized value of ice[] in transpiration()

	Files affected:

	canopy_evap.c

	Description:

	Modified to initialize ice[] for all soil layers before computing
	available moisture (to avoid using uninitialized values later on).



Uninitialized value of mixdepth in solve_lake()

	Files affected:

	lakes.eb.c

	Description:

	Now set mixdepth=0 for case of complete ice cover; this guarantees that
	it is initialized for all cases.



Missing ID String

	Files affected:

	initialize_lake.c

	Description:

	Added RCS ID string.



Unused file "init_snow"

	Files affected:

	initialize_snow.c
	vicNl.h

	Description:

	Removed reference to unused file "init_snow" from argument list.



Incorrect sub-daily temperature interpolation when referencing GMT instead of
local time

	Files affected:

	calc_air_temperature.c

	Description:

	Temperature interpolation didn't account for case in which min or max
	temperature could cross the boundary of the current day.  This can
	happen when referencing GMT instead of local time, for cells far away
	from 0 E longitude.  This has been fixed. TJB


Access of uninitialized variables

	Files affected:

	initialize_lake.c
	lakes.eb.c
	put_data.c
	read_vegparam.c

	Description:

	Uninitialized variables were accessed in several parts of the code:
	  put_data.c:
	    overstory              (never assigned a value)
	    lake->aero_resist      (only initialized when ice present)
	    lake->aero_resist_used (only initialized when ice present)
	  lakes.eb.c:
	    lake_snow->MELTING     (only sometimes assigned a value)

	In addition, read_vegparam.c was not allocating the correct number of
	veg tiles in the case that options.LAKES was FALSE.

	These have been fixed.


Water budget errors in snow pack on top of lake ice

	Files affected:

	lakes.eb.c

	Description:

	Convert swq and surf_water from mm over lake to mm over ice fraction at
	beginning of solve_lake().  This was needed to avoid a water budget
	error since swq and surf_water were being converted to mm over lake at
	end of solve_lake().



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r2 to VIC 4.1.0 beta r3 *****
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


New Features:
-------------

Improved lake model

	Files Affected:
	CalcBlowingSnow.c, LAKE.h, IceEnergyBalance.c, ice_melt.c,
	initialize_atmos.c, initialize_lake.c, lakes.eb.c, read_lakeparam.c,
	solve_snow.c, surface_fluxes.c, vicNl.h, vicNl_def.h,
	water_energy_balance.c, water_under_ice.c

	Description:
	This fixes the following bugs:

		Lake model crashes when lakes fill up
		Lake model crashes when lakes dry out

	And introduces the following new features:

		Blowing snow sublimation computed over lakes
		Tuning of default lake profile (parabolic to square)

	The new parameter BETA in LAKE.h can be used to control the shape of the
	automatic lake profile (when the global option LAKE_PROFILE is FALSE).
	BETA=0.5 is strongly parabolic, while BETA=0.001 is almost square
	(vertical walls).

	If LAKE_PROFILE=FALSE, the lake parameter file from VIC 4.1.0 beta 2 can
	be used without any changes.  However, if LAKE_PROFILE=TRUE, the lake
	parameter file must now contain a (depth,area) pair for each lake node.
	See read_lakeparam.c for details.
	

VIC now supports ALMA input and output variables.

	Files affected:
	Makefile, conv_force_vic2alma.c, conv_results_vic2alma.c, close_files.c,
	display_current_settings.c, dist_prec.c, get_force_type.c,
	get_global_param.c, initialize_atmos.c, initialize_global.c,
	make_in_and_outfiles.c, put_data.c, read_atmos_data.c, vicNl.h,
	vicNl_def.h, write_data.c, write_forcing_file.c

	Description:
	VIC now supports ALMA input and output variables.  To have VIC read ALMA
	input (forcing) variables, all that is required is to identify them by
	the appropriate names in the forcing section of the global parameter file.
	The appropriate names are listed in vicNl_def.h.  To have VIC write ALMA
	output variables, it is necessary to include the option ALMA_OUTPUT in the
	global parameter file and set it to TRUE.  This option does not affect
	model physics.


State file is now written at the END of the final timestep of the date indicated
in the global parameter file.

	Files affected:
	dist_prec.c

	Description:
	Previous versions of VIC wrote the state file at the beginnning of the
	date indicated (via STATEYEAR, STATEMONTH, and STATEDAY) in the global
	parameter file.  For sub-daily model time steps, this meant that the
	simulation's end could not be aligned exactly with the writing of the
	state file, since the model would continue simluating for the remainder
	of the final day after writing the state file.  This created difficulties
	when running VIC in real-time simulations, in which the forcings are
	broken up into short time periods and the previous state file must be
	used as the initial condition for the next time period.

	Now that the state file is written at the end of the final timestep of the
	date indicated in the global parameter file, it is possible for the end of
	a forcing file, the end of the simulation, and the timing of the state file
	all to align on the same time.  This simplifies re-starting the model for
	a forcing file that begins immediately after the previous forcing file
	ended, since the state file now is equivalent to the initial condition at
	the beginning of the new forcing file.


EQUAL_AREA global parameter option

	Files affected:
	display_current_settings.c, get_global_param.c, initialize_global.c,
	read_lakeparam.c, vicNl_def.h

	Description:
	New global parameter option.  When EQUAL_AREA is TRUE, all grid cells are
	assumed to have the same area, and the global parameter RESOLUTION is
	interpreted to store the grid cell area in km^2.  When EQUAL_AREA is FALSE,
	grid cells are assumed to have the same side length in degrees, and
	RESOLUTION is interpreted to store the grid cell side length in degrees,
	as before.


Improved validation of global options

	Files affected:
	get_global_param.c

	Description:
	Now does not allow bad combinations of FULL_ENERGY, FROZEN_SOIL, and
	GRND_FLUX values.


Improved validation of soil param file

	Files affected:
	read_soilparam.c

	Description:
	Now validates depth_full_snow_cover and frost_slope.


New vicInterp executable

	Files affected:
	Makefile, check_files.c, close_files.c, get_global_param.c,
	read_soilparam.c, vicNl.c

	Description:
	Now users can create a stand-alone executable called "vicInterp" by
	typing "make interp".  This executable is a stripped-down version 
	of VIC that reads a set of forcing files and outputs diurnally-varying
	sub-daily forcings.  The interpolation scheme, based on the Thornton and
	Running (mtclim) algorithm, can convert from from daily Prec, Tmin, Tmax,
	and Wind to sub-daily Prec, AirTemp, Shortwave and Longwave radiation,
	Wind, Pressure, and air Density.  The interpolated forms of Prec, Wind,
	Pressure, and Density do not vary diurnally but are assumed constant
	during each day.

	vicInterp is vicNl, compiled with the OUTPUT_FORCE option set to TRUE.
	As such, vicInterp can read a standard VIC global parameter file.  While
	it will ignore many of the options, it understands (and requires) the
	following:
		TIMESTEP
		STARTYEAR
		STARTMONTH
		STARTDAY
		STARTHOUR
		ENDYEAR
		ENDMONTH
		ENDDAY
		GRID_DECIMAL
		FORCING1
		N_TYPES
		FORCE_TYPE
		FORCE_FORMAT
		FORCE_ENDIAN
		FORCE_DT
		FORCEYEAR
		FORCEMONTH
		FORCEDAY
		FORCEHOUR
		SOIL
		RESULT_DIR
	In addition, the following options are optional:
		BINARY_OUTPUT
		ALMA_OUTPUT

	For example, if FORCE_DT is 24 and TIMESTEP is 3, vicInterp will
	interpolate the input daily forcings to a 3-hour time step.  If
	ALMA_OUTPUT is TRUE, these output forcings will be standard ALMA
	variables.

	This new feature also involves an update to the OUTPUT_FORCE option
	that fixes a bug in which output files were not properly closed
	before exiting.  This prevented all of the output data from being
	completely written.

Added sample global param file to distribution

        Files affected:
        global.param.sample

Bug Fixes:
----------

Large water balance errors in daily water balance mode when snow is present

	Files affected:
	surface_fluxes.c

	Description:
	Fixed broken snow step in surface_fluxes.c.  Per-snow-step snow
	quantities were being reset at the beginning of each canopy-surface
	energy balance iteration, preventing snow characteristics from being
	accumulated over all snow steps, and resulting in large water balance
	errors.  Now per-iteration snow quantities are stored separately
	from per-snow-step quantities.


Aerodynamic resistance incorrect in output fluxes file

        Files affected:
        IceEnergyBalance.c, LAKE.h, SnowPackEnergyBalance.c,
        calc_surf_energy_bal.c, full_energy.c, func_canopy_energy_bal.c,
        func_surf_energy_bal.c, ice_melt.c, lakes.eb.c, put_data.c,
        snow_intercept.c, snow_melt.c, solve_snow.c, surface_fluxes.c,
        vicNl.h, vicNl_def.h, wetland_energy.c

        Description:
        In 4.1.0 beta r2 and earlier, the aerodynamic resistance written to the
        output fluxes file rarely reflected the value actually used in flux
        computations.  This has been fixed.

        VIC actually computes an array of 3 different aerodynamic resistances,
        as follows:
          aero_resist[0] : over vegetation or bare soil
          aero_resist[1] : over snow-filled overstory
          aero_resist[2] : over snow pack
        VIC determines which element of the array to use depending on the
	current vegetation type and whether snow is present.  In addition, in
	most cases, VIC applies a stability correction to this aerodynamic
	resistance before using it in flux computations.  Furthermore, when the
	current vegetation tile contains overstory and snow is present on the
	ground, aero_resist[2] is used for snow pack flux computations and
	either aero_resist[1] or aero_resist[0] is used for canopy flux
	computations, meaning that two different aerodynamic resistances are in
	use in the same time step.

        However, VIC 4.1.0 beta r2 always wrote the uncorrected value of
        aero_resist[0] to the fluxes file.

        In 4.1.0 beta r3 and later, the value written to the fluxes file is the
        actual value used in flux computations, including any corrections that
        were applied.  In the case mentioned above in which two different
        aerodynamic resistances are in use at the same time, the one used for
        the snow pack is written.  In addition, the aerodynamic resistance of
        the canopy air/surrounding atmosphere interface is not tracked.


Aerodynamic resistance not correctly aggregated for output

	Files affected:
	conv_results_vic2alma.c, put_data.c, vicNl_def.h

	Description:
	In previous releases, aerodynamic resistance (out_data->aero_resist)
	was aggregated by a simple area-weighted average over veg tiles.  This
	led to an aggregate value that was not the true effective resistance
	of the entire grid cell.  Since evaporation is proportional to
	1/aero_resist, it is (1/aero_resist), or the aerodynamic conductivity,
	that should be averaged over the grid cell.  Therefore, a new variable,
	out_data.aero_cond, was created for the purposes of aggregation.  After
	aggregation, out_data.aero_resist is computed as 1/out_data.aero_cond.

	The effect of the change is most pronounced when there is a large range
	of values of aerodynamic resistance among the veg tiles in a grid cell.
	The effective aerodynamic resistance, computed the new way, will tend
	to be smaller than the old way when the values cover a wide range.
	However, the effective aerodynamic resistance will never be smaller than
	the smallest value among the various veg tiles in the cell.
	

Attempts to skip deactivated grid cells fail when using a binary initial state
file.

	Files affected:
	write_model_state.c

	Description:
	write_model_state() now computes the correct number of bytes per record
	for a binary state file.  Before this fix, if a user de-activated some
	grid cells (by setting the first field in the soil parameter file to 0)
	and attempted to read from a binary state file that was written when the
	cells were active, VIC would not read the state file correctly and would
	crash.


State variables for SPATIAL_FROST and LAKE_MODEL options not stored in state
file.

	Files affected:
	dist_prec.c, initialize_model_state.c, read_initial_model_state.c,
	vicNl.h, write_model_state.c

	Description:
	State variables for SPATIAL_FROST and LAKE_MODEL options were not stored
	in state files, causing these variables to be reset to default values
	when reading from an initial state file.  This has been fixed.

	NOTE: this fix involves a change in the format of state files which
	makes state files used with 4.1.0 beta 3 incompatible with earlier
	releases (and vice versa).


State files not written/read correctly when QUICK_FLUX set to TRUE.

	Files affected:
	get_global_param.c, make_dist_prcp.c, make_energy_bal.c, vicNl.c,
	vicNl.h

	Description:
	In previous releases, if QUICK_FLUX=TRUE, the number of soil thermal
	nodes is changed after being recorded in the state file.  The resulting
	mismatch between Nnodes in the state file header and the actual number
	of node temperatures recorded in the state file prevents VIC from being
	able to read the state file.  This has been fixed.


Automatic re-adjustment of lake fraction when sum of veg and lake fractions
exceeds 1 can set lake fraction to 0.

	Files affected:
	LAKE.h, read_lakeparam.c, vicNl.c

	Description:
	In earlier releases, the automatic re-adjustment of the lake fraction
	when the sum of the veg and lake fractions exceeds 1 can reset the lake
	fraction to 0.  This has been changed so that the veg and lake
	fractions all share proportionally in the re-adjustment.


Fixed incorrect check on soil moisture in distribute_node_moisture_properties().

	Files affected:
	soil_conduction.c

	Description:
	distribute_node_moisture_properties() contained the following check:
		if(abs(moist_node[nidx]-max_moist_node[nidx]) > SMALL)
	Checking the absolute value here was incorrect.  The abs() has been
	removed.


Fixed incorrect check on soil node depths in read_initial_model_state().

	Files affected:
	read_initial_model_state.c

	Description:
	read_initial_model_state() contained the following check:
		if( abs( sum - soil_con->dp ) > SMALL )
	Checking the absolute value here was incorrect.  The abs() has been
	removed.


ARNO_PARAMS global parameter option changed to BASEFLOW

        Files affected:
        display_current_settings.c
        get_global_param.c
        global.param.sample
        initialize_global.c
        read_soilparam.c
        read_soilparam_arc.c
        vicNl_def.h

        Changed the name of the ARNO_PARAMS global parameter option to
        BASEFLOW.  The meaning of the ARNO_PARAMS option was actually
        opposite to its name: when ARNO_PARAMS was FALSE, VIC would
        interpret the first four parameters in the soil parameter file
        to be the standard ARNO soil parameters Ds, Dsmax, Ws, and c,
        while when ARNO_PARAMS was TRUE, VIC would interpret the first
        four parameters to be d1, d2, d3, and d4, the soil parameters
        used in Nijssen et al. (2001).  The new option now can take
        values of "ARNO" and "NIJSSEN2001".  When BASEFLOW == NIJSSEN2001,
        VIC assumes the soil parameter file contains d1, d2, d3, and d4.
        When BASEFLOW == ARNO, VIC assumes the soil parameter file
        contains Ds, Dsmax, Ws, and c.


Replaced %i with %d in fscanf statements

	Files affected:
	check_state_file.c, get_global_param.c, read_arcinfo_ascii.c,
	read_initial_model_state.c, read_snowband.c, read_soilparam.c,
	read_veglib.c

	Description:
	Having %i in fscanf statements was causing input values of "08" to be
	interpreted as octal rather than decimal.  These instances of %i have
	been replaced with %d.

Removed some snowband output

	Files affected:
	write_data.c

	Description:
        Removed  net sw radiation, net lw, albedo, latent heat flux, 
	sensible heat flux, ground heat flux

STATE file option is now specified in global file, not in user_def.h at compile time

        Files affected:

        display_current_settings.c
        dist_prec.c
        get_global_param.c
        initialize_global.c
        open_state_file.c
        user_def.h
        vicNl.c
        vicNl.h
        vicNl_def.h
        write_model_state.c

        Previously, to be able to read/write state files, VIC required
        users to define SAVE_STATE to be TRUE in user_def.h and
        recompile VIC, in addition to having the correct settings of
        INIT_STATE, STATENAME, STATEYEAR, STATEMONTH, and STATEDAY in
        the global parameter file.

        This was both unnecessary and confusing.  Setting SAVE_STATE
        to FALSE did not improve VIC performance noticeably, and
        having both a SAVE_STATE compile option and state file
        information in the global parameter file only led to mistakes
        in which the user made a change in one place without realizing
        a change needed to be made elsewhere.

        Now VIC behaves as follows:
        1. To read an initial state file, the following line
        must be in the global parameter file:
          INIT_STATE init_state_filename

        where init_state_filename is the name of the initial state
        file.  If this line is absent or commented out (preceded by a
        "#"), VIC will start from default initial conditions.

        2. To write a state file during the simulation, the
        following lines must be in the global parameter file:
          STATENAME  state_file_name
          STATEYEAR  state_year
          STATEMONTH state_month
          STATEDAY   state_day

        where state_file_name is the path and prefix of the file to
        save the state information in (the simulation date on which
        the state file is saved will be appended to the state file
        name), and state_year, state_month, and state_day are the
        year, month, and day of the simulation on which to save state.
        The state will be saved AFTER the FINAL time step of that
        date.  If all of these lines are absent or commented out, VIC
        will not save a state file.  If some (but not all) of these
        lines are present, VIC will give an error.

Fixed bug in error trapping when INIT_STATE filename matches SAVE_STATE filename

        Files affected:
        get_global_param.c, open_state_file.c

        Previously, the checks for matches would occur in get_global_param even
        though the SAVE_STATE filename wasn't created until open_state_file.
        The output name setting was moved from open_state_file to get_global_param. GCT

Added checks for range/valid month days

        Files affected:
        get_global_param.c

        In previous versions the user could set a non-valid date for STATE files
        and the model would run without writing to STATE file. Code now checks
        for valid date.

Allow user to use NO_FLUX in addition to NOFLUX for NOFLUX option in global param file

        Files affected:
        get_global_param.c

Now reads extra_veg from state file

        Files affected:
        read_initial_model_state.c
               
Removed Trad from vicNl_def.h

        Files affected:
        vicNl_def.h

Modified to read lake nodal variables for each of the active nodes. (JCA)

        Files affected:
        read_initial_model_state.c
        write_model_state.c

Reverting from version 5.10 to 5.9 in surface_fluxes.c 

        Files affected:
        surface_fluxes.c

        Energy balance errors had been introduced in the changes from 5.9 to 5.10.
        This is an intermittent problem that appears to depend on versions of FreeBSD
        when compiling with the optimization flag. This temporary reversion should
        be okay as long as the time steps are sub-daily.  GCT


Skip reading/writing of snow band for areafract <= 0

        Files affected:
        read_initial_model_state.c
        write_model_state.c

        This will reduce the size of the statefile. GCT


Lake model energy terms NaN for southern hemisphere lakes

        Files affected:
        lakes.eb.c

        The computation of ks in the eddy() function was attempting to compute
	  ks=6.6*pow(sin((double)lat*PI/180.),0.5)*pow(wind,-1.84);
	however, in the southern hemisphere, lat is negative and ks evaluates
	to NaN, causing lake temperatures to all become NaN.  This line has
	been replaced by
	  ks=6.6*pow(sin((double)fabs(lat)*PI/180.),0.5)*pow(wind,-1.84);
	This appears to fix the problem.	TJB

Changed argument order in fread, fwrite statements.

        Files affected:
        check_state_file.c
        open_state_file.c
        read_atmos_data.c
        read_initial_model_state.c
        write_data.c
        write_forcing_file.c
        write_model_state.c

        Statements had arguments with ...1, sizeof()....Those were changed to
        ...sizeof(), 1, ...GCT

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***** Description of changes from VIC 4.1.0 beta r1 to VIC 4.1.0 beta r2 *****
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


New Features:
-------------

"-v" and "-o" command-line options and display of run/compile-time options

        Files affected:
        cmd_proc.c, display_current_settings.c, get_global_param.c, global.h,
        vicNl.c, vicNl.h, vicNl_def.h

        Description:
        In VIC 4.1.0 beta r2, if VERBOSE is TRUE, all compile-time options (from
        user_def.h) and run-time options (from your global parameter file) are
        displayed for you at the beginning of a model run.  If you are saving
        your model output to a log file, this information will be stored with
        your log, so you will have a record of the option settings that produced
        the results of that particular model run.

	The new "-v" option will display the release number of your vicNl
	executable.  For example, typing:
		vicNl -v
	gives
		***** VIC Version 4.1.0 Beta Release 2 *****

        Meanwhile, the new "-o" option displays the current compile-time
        options.  One benefit of this option is that you can see what the
        options in user_def.h were set to when vicNl was compiled, without
        having to start a model run.  Since your version of user_def.h may have
        changed since you compiled vicNl, this is the most reliable way to see
        what these options are set to.  For example:

	gen.hydro.washington.edu 175: vicNl -o

	***** VIC Version 4.1.0 Beta Release 2 - Current Model Settings *****

	COMPILE-TIME OPTIONS (set in user_def.h)

Automatic recompilation on updates to *.h

        Files affected:
        Makefile

        Description:
        In VIC 4.1.0 beta r1, updating a .h file and recompiling VIC would not
	result in recompilation of files that depend on the .h file, unless a
	"make clean" command was issued first.  Now, if any .h files are
        updated, all dependent .c files are recompiled on the next "make".


NEW_ARNO_TYPE global option is now ARNO_PARAMS

	Files affected:
	get_global_param.c, read_soilparam.c, vicNl_def.h

	Description:
	Changed the name of the global option NEW_ARNO_TYPE to be ARNO_PARAMS.
	"NEW_ARNO_TYPE" is confusing, since this option will not be new
	forever, and doesn't refer to a "type" but rather a set of parameters.

	NOTE: This change requires the user to replace all occurrences of
	"NEW_ARNO_TYPE" in their global control files with "ARNO_PARAMS".


Bug Fixes:
----------

Spurious condensation at low temperatures

        Files affected:
        arno_evap.c

        Description:
        Changed logic of evap limit check to avoid creating spurious
        condensation.  In VIC 4.1.0 beta r1, whenever evaporation > (liquid
        moisture - residual moisture), evaporation would be set to (liquid
        moisture - residual moisture).  However, at low temperatures, when most
        or all soil moisture is frozen, liquid moisture < residual moisture,
        causing (liquid moisture - residual moisture) to be negative.  Any non-
        negative evap would be greater than this, resulting in evap getting set
        to (liquid moisture - residual moisture), which would be negative (i.e.
        condensation).  This artificially created condensation in whatever
        amount necessary to bring liquid moisture up to residual, causing 1)
        large latent heat flux, 2) incorrect surface temperatures, 3) occasional
        inability for calc_surf_energy_bal to converge in root_brent, and 4)
        spuriously high runoff and baseflow.  Now there is an added condition
        that liquid moisture > residual moisture for evap to be capped at
        (liquid moisture - residual moisture).

        NOTE: This fix results in lower runoff and baseflow in unvegetated areas
        with frozen soils, and may require recalibration of soil parameters.


Validation of initial soil moisture

        Files affected:
        read_soilparam.c, read_soilparam_arc.c

        Description:
        Added check to read_soilparam.c and read_soilparam_arc.c to make sure
        that wilting point is greater than residual moisture.  Changed lower
        limit on initial soil moisture to be residual moisture rather than
        wilting point.  Made validation statements clearer.  Validation does
        not occur if soil moisture will be read from a model state file.
        (found and fixed by Chunmei Zhu, Alan Hamlet, and Ted Bohn)

        NOTE: Soil parameter files containing Wpwp_FRACT and resid_moist
        such that Wpwp_FRACT < resid_moist / (1.0 - bulk_density/soil_density)
        will now cause VIC to exit with an error message.


Incorrect baseflow limits

        Files affected:
        runoff.c

        Description:
        In 4.1.0 beta r1, runoff.c checked for the wrong bounds on baseflow,
        allowing baseflow to become negative when liquid soil moisture < residual
        moisture.  These bounds have been fixed in 4.1.0 beta r2, as follows:
        baseflow is not allowed to exceed (liquid soil moisture - residual moisture);
        when baseflow < 0, baseflow is set to 0; when baseflow > 0 and the resulting
        soil moisture < residual moisture, water is taken out of baseflow and
        given to the soil as follows:
          if baseflow > (residual moisture - soil moisture), then
            baseflow -= (residual moisture - soil moisture);
            soil moisture += (residual moisture - soil moisture);
          else
            soil moisture += baseflow;
            baseflow = 0;

        NOTE: This fix may result in small changes in baseflow and evaporation.


Runs using initial state files starting at state file date rather than global
start date

        Files affected:
        check_state_file.c

        Description:
        In 4.1.0 beta r1, check_state_file.c would increment the index of the
        forcing data array until it reached the record corresponding to the date
        stored in the state file.  This caused the simulation to start at the
        date at which the state file was saved rather than the start date
        specified in the global parameter file.  If the state file's date was
        earlier than the start date in the global parameter file, the index
        would be incremented until a segmentation fault occurred.  This has
        been fixed in 4.1.0 beta r2 so that the start date in the global parameter
        file is always the start date of the simulation.  The date stored in
        the initial state file is ignored.

        NOTE: If you have been relying on the state file to dictate when your
        simulations start, this fix may require you to change your global
        parameter file so that STARTYEAR, STARTMONTH, etc. reflect the start
        date/time you want.


Incorrect sublimation values for BLOWING option

	Files affected:
	CalcBlowingSnow.c, IceEnergyBalance.c, SnowPackEnergyBalance.c,
	calc_surf_energy_bal.c, func_surf_energy_bal.c, ice_melt.c, lakes.eb.c,
	latent_heat_from_snow.c, put_data.c, snow_melt.c, solve_snow.c,
	surface_fluxes.c, vicNl.h, vicNl_def.h

	Description:
	Fixed 3 bugs in the sublimation terms: 1) sub_surface was wrong when
	snow step was not 1 hour, 2) sub_blowing was wrong under certain
	conditions, and 3) sub_blowing and sub_surface did not contain the
	contribution from lakes, even though sub_total did.  The fix
	establishes the convention that the internal variables VaporMassFlux,
	BlowingMassFlux, and SurfaceMassFlux always have units of kg/m2s; and
	that internal variables vapor_flux, blowing_flux, and surface_flux
	always have units of m/timestep.  Unnecessary terms were removed from
	the parameter lists of several functions.

	NOTE: The effects of this fix on major water balance terms such as
	runoff, baseflow, evaporation, etc. should be very small.

	NOTE 2: The lake contribution to sub_blowing is currently set to 0.


Negative incoming shortwave radiation at high latitudes

        Files affected:
        mtclim42_vic.c

        Description:
        In 4.1.0 beta r1, when sub-daily shortwave radiation is estimated from
        daily min/max temperatures, negative values occasionally are calculated
        in coastal areas above the Arctic Circle in winter.  Now, if estimated
        sub-daily incident shortwave is negative, it is set to 0.0.


Undefined daily precipitation for deserts

        Files affected:
        mtclim42_vic.c

        Description:
        In 4.1.0 beta r1, if a grid cell's annual precipitation (specified in
        the soil parameter file) is 0, then the adjusted daily precipitation
        calculated in mtclim42_vic.c ends up being undefined.  In 4.1.0 beta r2
        this has been fixed.

        More specifically, the MTCLIM 4.2 algorithm (which VIC uses for
        estimating sub-daily forcing values) was originally set up to expect a
        base precipitation as an input, and to translate this base precip into
        a site-specific precip via an adjustment function.  The adjustment
        function multiplies the base precip by the ratio of site_isohyet to
        base_isohyet to get site precipitation.  In calling the MTCLIM 4.2
        functions, VIC sets site_isohyet and base_isohyet to the grid cell's
        annual precipitation.  So this ratio should always = 1.  However,
        when annual precipitation is 0.0, this ratio is undefined.  So, the
        fix is to set the ratio to 1 when both site_isohyet and base_isohyet
        are 0 (or very small). (found by Liz Clark)


Snow_flux incorrectly set to Tcanopy in fluxes output file

	Files affected:
	put_data.c

	Description:
	In 4.1.0 beta r1, the snow_flux output variable was incorrectly set to
	Tcanopy.  This has been corrected.


Incorrect value for sub_snow in fluxes output file

	Files affected:
	write_data.c

	Description:
	Replaced output of sub_snow[0] in fluxes file with sub_total.


Mixmax uninitialized

	Files affected:
	water_under_ice.c

	Description:
	The variable mixmax was used in a max-finding loop without first being
	initialized.  It is now initialized to 0 before being used.


Typo in SPATIAL_FROST code in snow_intercept.c

	Files affected:
	snow_intercept.c

	Description:
	Fixed typo.  Changed SPATIAL_FRoST to SPATIAL_FROST.


Incorrect skipping over masked-out cells when reading initial state file

	Files affected:
	read_initial_model_state.c

	Description:
	In 4.1.0 beta r1, the algorithm parsing the initial state file was
	incorrect when attempting to skip over records for cells that were
	excluded from the mask (by setting the "active" flag in the first field
	of the soil file to 0).  This has been fixed.

	More specifically, the algorithm has been modified to loop over
	tmp_Nveg and tmp_Nband when searching for desired cellnum in ASCII file,
	rather than over Nveg and Nbands.  As we skip over other records in the
	state file while searching for the desired record, the loop must parse
	each undesired record differently, according to how many veg classes and
	snow bands exist in the record (tmp_Nveg and tmp_Nband, respectively),
	rather than the number of veg classes and snow bands in the desired
	record (Nveg and Nbands, respectively).


Incorrect bounds for snow depth

	Files affected:
	snow_utility.c

	Description:
	Modified the checks on delta_depth so that the condition is
		delta_depth > MAX_CHANGE*depth
	Modified compression due to aging to only be calculated if depth > 0.


100% snow when air_temp = MAX_SNOW_TEMP

        Files affected:
        calc_rainonly.c

        Description:
        In 4.1.0 beta r1, when air_temp = MAX_SNOW_TEMP, the portion of
	precipitation that is snow was set to 100%.  This has been fixed.
	(found by Justin Sheffield at Princeton)


Special case in Penman equation

        Files affected:
        penman.c

        Description:
        Changed
                if (vpd > 0.0 && evap < 0.0)
        to
                if (vpd >= 0.0 && evap < 0.0)
        to correctly handle evap when vpd == 0.0. (found by Justin Sheffield
        at Princeton)


Rint() function not supported on all platforms

        Files affected:
        compute_dz.c, initialize_atmos.c, read_soilparam.c,
        read_soilparam_arc.c

        Description:
        Replaced rint(something) with (float)(int)(something + 0.5) to
        handle rounding without resorting to rint(), which isn't supported
        on all platforms.  (found by Justin Sheffield at Princeton)


Global parameter initialization

        Files affected:
        initialize_global.c

        Description:
        Initialize ARC_SOIL, COMPRESS, and ARNO_PARAMS to FALSE.  Also changed
        limit on loop over forcing types from hard-coded 17 to variable
        N_FORCING_TYPES.  (found by Justin Sheffield at Princeton)


Bottom soil node thickness initialization

        Files affected:
        initialize_model_state.c

        Description:
        Initialize soil_con->dz_node[Nnodes] to 0.0, since it is accessed in
        set_node_parameters().  (found by Justin Sheffield at Princeton)


Initialization of debug parameters

        Files affected:
        open_debug.c

        Description:
        Initialize debug_store_moist array when debug.PRT_MOIST is true (as
        well as under the other previously-defined conditions). (found by
        Justin Sheffield at Princeton)


Canopy evaporation and distributed precipitation

        Files affected:
        surface_fluxes.c

        Description:
        Fixed initialization of canopyevap to initialize for every value of
        dist, rather than just dist 0. (found by Justin Sheffield at Princeton)


Output debug file error

        Files affected:
        write_atmosdata.c

        Description:
        No longer close the debug file, since the next cell must write to it.
        (found by Justin Sheffield at Princeton)


Calculation of deltaH when FS_ACTIVE is FALSE

        Files affected:
        func_surf_energy_bal.c

        Description:
        Added check that both FS_ACTIVE and FROZEN_SOIL are true before
        adjusting *deltaH.  This is just a safety measure; ice and ice0 should
        both be 0 when FS_ACTIVE is FALSE.  (found by Justin Sheffield at
        Princeton)


Root_brent error message clarification

        Files affected:
        calc_atmos_energy_bal.c, calc_surf_energy_bal.c, frozen_soil.c,
	ice_melt.c, root_brent.c, snow_intercept.c, snow_melt.c, vicNl.h

        Description:
        Instead of printing warning or error messages, root_brent.c now
	passes descriptions of the errors to the functions that called it,
        leaving it to them to describe the specific error and its consequences.
	In 4.0.4, root_brent's messages sometimes were wrong.


Display current grid cell number for arc/info soil files

        Files affected:
        read_soilparam_arc.c

        Description:
        In 4.1.0 beta r1, for arc/info-format soil files, the current grid
        cell is not displayed (for regular-format soil files, it is displayed).
        Now the current grid cell number is always displayed.


Binary file opening message

        Files affected:
        open_file.c

        Description:
        In 4.1.0 beta r1, the message announcing the opening of a binary input
        file for reading was truncated.  This has been fixed.


Extra options in user_def.h

	Files affected:
	user_def.h

	Description:
	Removed SPATIAL_FROST_SLOPE and MAX_FULL_COVERAGE_DEPTH since they were
	not used anywhere.


Unnecessary freeing of LINK_DEBUG

	Files affected:
	alloc_atmos.c

	Description:
	Added check for LINK_DEBUG global option.  If LINK_DEBUG is TRUE
	atmospheric data is not dynamically allocated, so it should not be
	freed.


Lakeparam element of filenames structure overloaded

	Files affected:
	close_files.c, make_in_and_outfiles.c, vicNl_def.h

	Description:
	The lakeparam element of the filenames structure was used to contain
	both the name of the input lakeparam file and the output lake file.
	An extra element has been added to the filenames structure so that the
	input lakeparam file and the output lake file can be referred to
	separately.


Inconsistent format in state file

	Files affected:
	write_model_state.c

	Description:
	Removed initial space on veg/band info line in ASCII file.


Pending Issues:
---------------

Lake model crashes when lake level gets too high

Lake model crashes when lake level gets too low

COMPUTE_TREELINE option non-functional

	Description:
	This issue is waiting for completion of a treeline-computation scheme
	that allows landcover fractions to be stated explicitly as a function
	of elevation band.

Lakes smeared across multiple elevation bands

	Description:
	Currently, VIC assumes that the percentage of grid cell area covered by
	lakes is constant throughout the grid cell, and therefore when multiple
	elevation bands are specified for a grid cell, the lake percentage is
	distributed evenly across all elevations.  However, when modeling large
	lakes, this assumption does not hold; the bulk of the lake coverage may
	be due to a single large lake, which by definition cannot exist in
	multiple elevation bands.  Therefore, we need a way of explicitly
	specifying lake coverage as a function of elevation.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Updates 7-30-2003: VIC 4.1.0 r1

    (1) Added support for ASCII as well as Binary state files (NOTE: ASCII
	state files were added for easier editing when trying to start the 
	model from observed state - Only Binary state files will produce
	identical runs if used to store and restart from the model state).
	Added BINARY_STATE_FILE to the global file, if TRUE state file I/O
	is in binary, if FALSE it is ASCII.
    (2) Made certain that local NOFLUX flag is set in calc_surf_energy_bal.c
	every time the routine is executed.
    (3) write_data.c: Corrected output of sub_snow variable to item [0] 
	rather than a point - will need to decide what parts of this array 
	are important to output.
    (4) Modified runoff.c so that only the top two layers are used when
	computing infiltration.  Previously, all but the bottom layer was 
	used.  Therefore this only affects you if you tried running with
	more than three layers.  This change was made as it makes more sense 
	for a situation where you are trying to improve the representation
        of the soil column by increasing the resolution (and perhaps depth)
	of the soil column.
    (5)	snow_utility.c (snow_density): Added check to keep compression from 
	aging from exceeding the actual depth of the snowpack.
    (6) solve_snow.c: Added check so that MELTING flag is only TRUE if melt
        occurs in the melt season - currently this is defined between March 1 
	and October 1.  Otherwise the MELTING flag can trigger rapid very 
	early season melt.

Updates 4-21-2003: Mering codes to form VIC 4.1.0 r0

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    From comparison of LatestAdminSource and LatestTestSource

    Dynamic allocation of as many arrays and structures as are currently 
    used by the VIC model cause electric fence (a memory debugging tool)
    to bog down/fail in the allocation process.  As the allocation of
    memory is unlikely to be the cause of new memory errors, hard wired 
    memory can be used instead, letting eleectric fence penetrate further
    into the code.
    alloc_atmos.c: (KAC) MEMORY_DEBUG update
	Modified so that dynamic allocation of the atmospheric data arrays
	does not occur when the debugging code is linked to the model.  
	This makes it possible to use electric fence to debug memory errors
	without changing the model code.  Previously, dynamic allocation
	of the atmospheric arrays was only skipped if VIC was configured 
	for optimization work.
    vicNl_def.h: (KAC) MEMORY_DEBUG update
        See alloc_atmos.c.

    Newest version of the model had water balance errors when using 
    distributed precipitation.  Model crashes were also witnessed.  Fixed
    errors introduced by other model updates.
    arno_evap.c: (KAC) DIST_PRCP fix
	Moved unit conversion of moist_resid outside of the distributed
	precipitation loop.  This prevents it from being multiplied by 
	D1 * 1000 twice for the DRY fraction of the grid cell.
    initialize_model_state.c: (KAC) DIST_PRCP fix
        Modified to initialize soil and vegetation parameters for the dry 
	grid cell fraction, if distributed precipitation is activated.
    snow_intercept.c: (KAC) DIST_PRCP fix
        Added check of intercepted before mass balance error calculation.  
	Since interception quantity can be greater than Wd_max when snow 
	is present, the routine could return dew values higher than maximum 
	in a time step when intercepted snow melted.  If there is no other 
	snow, and distributed precipitation is active this could cause the 
	model to crash in redistribute_during_storm as it will be unable to 
	conserve water when too much water is in the canopy.

    ** Make sure that all updates from surface_fluxes.c are accounted for
    after merge with 4.0.4beta **

        v4.0.4 multiplies nrecs by NF to check for a long enough file,

    solve_snow.c: (KAC)
	- Added partial snow cover and advection of sensible heat from local 
	bare patches.
	- Modified to pass the minimum depth of full snow cover as a variable 
	in soil_con rather than a globally defined constant.
	- Fixed check of new snow accumulation for setting understory flag to 
	use snowfall[WET] not snowfall.
	- Set MELTING flag to maintain melting albedo curve even during brief 
	periods of refreezing, until a snowfall exceeds SnowThres.
	- Modified to handle the effects of blowing snow.
	- Modified to handle closed canopy energy balance.
    surface_fluxes.c: (KAC)
        - Modified to handle partial snow cover.
        - Modified to iterate a solution for the exchange of energy between 
	the snowpack and the ground surface.
        - Modified to add the effects of blowing snow.
        - Fixed indexing problem for sub-daily snow model within daily water 
	balance VIC: hour (now hidx) is incremented by 1 rather than the 
	sub-daily time step, so the atmospheric forcing data is now properly 
	indexed.
	- Indexing fix sent SNOW_STEP to calc_surf_energy_bal rather than the 
	model time step, meaning that without snow the evaporation was 
	computed for SNOW_STEP hours rather than a full day.  This was fixed 
	by introducing step_inc to index the arrays, while step_dt keeps 
	track of the correct time step.
    svp.c: (KAC)
        Modified internal calculations to use kPa rather than Pa for 
	consistancy
    user_def.h: (KAC)

	computing the treeline, computing statistics from the input 
	forcings, and controls for spatial snow and frost.

	can make use of the computed treeline.
	- Modified to initialize storm parameters using the state file.
        - Modified to start the model by skipping records until the state 
	file date is found.  This replaces the previous method of modifying 
	the global file start date, which can change the interpolation of 
	atmospheric forcing data.
	- Modified to store wet and dry fractions when intializing water 
	balance storage.  This accounts for changes in model state 
	initialization, which now stores wet and dry fractions rather than 
	just averaged values.
    vicNl.h: (KAC)
        Added definitions for treeline and forcing stats subroutines and
	made some needed modifications to subroutine definitions due to
	other changes, however, other changes still need to be made.

        Modified to handle lake algorithm, blowing snow, spatial snow and
	frost, and treeline calculations.
    write_data.c: (KAC)
	- Made hour a variable in all output data file formats even if the 
	model is run at a daily time step.  Also modified all output files 
	to account for new variables introduced by the spatial frost and 
	snow algorithms, the lake algorithm and the PILPS 2e study.
	- Added energy fluxes to snow band output files.
	- Updated output of model for lakes and wetlands algorithm.  Added 
	output of blowing snow sublimation to LDAS and standard snow output 
	files.  ** No Lake Variables are included in the LDAS output format. 
	**
	- Modified LDAS SWQ output, so that it is multiplied by 10 instead 
	of 100 before being converted to a short integer.  This reduces 
	stored value precision to 0.1, but increases the maximum storable 
	SWQ, which was exceeded in previous LDAS simulations.
        - Eliminated different formats between energy balance and water
	balance model output.
    write_debug.c: (KAC)

	as Pa for backward compatability.
    write_layer.c: (KAC)
        Modified to handle spatial soil frost.
    write_model_state.c: (KAC)
	- Rewritten to handle updates to vicNl_def.h and to write the file 
	as binary to minimize write time and differences with simulations 
	started with the state file.
	- Model is now restarted with the correct values for mu and 
	LAST_STORM.
        ** Still need to account for differences with distributed 
	precipitation flags, which now differ with vegetation - also need
	to check storage of lake variables, blowing snow variables and 
	MELTING flag.

June 4, 2003: VIC release 4.0.4beta r2

This covers bugs found during tests with the snow algorithm.

        solve_snow.c: Bug found by KAC
	    Counter for number of days since last snowfall was 
	    incremented twice in the MELTING update.  This has been
	    fixed.
	solve_snow.c: modification by KAC
	    Added check so that MELTING flag is only TRUE if melt
	    occurs in the melt season - currently this is defined
	    between March 1 and October 1.  Otherwise the MELTING
	    flag can trigger rapid very early season melt
	write_model_state.c, read_initial_model_state.c, open_state_file.c,
	check_state_file.c: Modification by KAC
	    Modified to handle both ASCII and BINARY state files.
	    NOTE: ASCII mode is designed to make it easier to create 
	    a state file for initializing a point model.  It includes 
	    all features of the Binary state file, but values are 
	    truncated so the resulting restart will not be identical.
	    If you need an exact restart, use the Binary files.  Also
	    removed ice content from the state file as it is computed
	    at the beginning of each time step, so storing its value
	    is unnecessary.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

April 23, 2003: VIC release 4.0.4beta r1

This covers bug fixes found by beta testers and fixed in the version of 
the code bundled with this file.

	surface_fluxes.c: (found by Ingjerd Haddeland)
	    Indexing fix sent SNOW_STEP to calc_surf_energy_bal rather
	    than the model time step, meaning that without snow the 
	    evaporation was computed for SNOW_STEP hours rather than a
	    full day.  This was fixed by introducing step_inc to 
	    index the arrays, while step_dt keeps track of the correct
	    time step. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

March 27, 2003: VIC release 4.0.4beta

This release covers patches for several bugs found in 4.0.3, which were 
never formally released (i.e. the downloadable source code was modified, 
but no major announcement was made).  It also includes other fixes and 
modifications that have been identified as being needed prior to releasing 
version 4.1.0, which will involve several significant changes (including 
lakes & wetlands, spatial snow & frost, and a closed canopy energy balance).

Modifications:

	Snow albedo update: (found by Keith)
	     In previous releases, the snow albedo function has been hyper 
	     sensitive to trace amounts of snowfall during the melt period.  
	     Whenever new snow falls or the cold content falls below 0, the 
	     albedo is switched from the ablation curve to the accumulation 
	     curve.  This curve is then followed until the cold content 
	     exceeds 0, indicating it is in the spring melt season.  This is 
	     fine when accounting for thin early season snowpacks or mid-
	     season melt events, however, a cold snap or light dusting of 
	     snow should not reset the snowpack albedo to much higher winter 
	     values for days or weeks at a time.  This release of the model 
	     monitors the state of pack with the variable MELTING.  This 
	     flag keeps the snowpack on the ablation curve unless new snow-
	     fall exceeds a threshold (TraceSnow in user_def.h) indicating 
	     that the top of the snowpack should be represented by the albedo 
	     of the new snow.
	Model initialization: (found by Ulysses and Keith)
	     In previous releases, the initialization of soil layer moist[] 
	     and ice[] was within a second set of loops for band and 
	     vegetation, using the same counters.  Because of the dual use
	     of counters, initialization was not completed correctly.  The
	     primary effect of this was that thermal node values beyond the
	     first vegetation type were not correctly initialized, which 
	     caused the model to crash during some simulations with full
             energy or frozen soils active.  Without frozen soil, most 
	     simulations would compensate for the problem within their
	     spin-up time, so it is unlikely that this bug impacts any 
	     simulations not employing frozen soil.
	Snow time step: (found by Andy, et al.)
	     The snow algorithm needs to run sub-daily for the energy balance
	     components to function properly.  This means that for daily 
	     simulations, the snow model must be solved at a finer (sub-daily)
	     time step.  In the previous release, initialize_atmos.c stored
	     sub-daily met data in each days variable using positions (e.g. 
             0,1,..8 for 3 hour data).  In surface_fluxes.c the model indexed 
	     the sub-daily time steps used by the snow algorithm with hours 
	     (e.g. 0,3,6,...21 for three hour data).  This means the arrays
	     were incorrectly indexed and the resulting model simulations 
	     would be wrong.  The fix implemented here has been tested under 
	     several model configurations and is deemed the official version.
	     WARNING: There are several versions of this fix circulating,
	     please update your code to this version - the previous fixes
	     may not work in all circumstances!
	FROZEN_SOIL active flag: (found by Ed and Justin)
	     The cause of the problem is a bug in the code that occurs when 
	     the global frozen soils flag (FROZEN_SOILS) is set to true but 
	     the individual cell frozen soil flag (FS_ACTIVE) is set to 
	     false. This causes the change in soil heat storage to be 
	     calculated incorrectly.  This was fixed by adding additional
	     conditions within frozen_soil.c and initialize_model_state.c,
	     which verify the FS_ACTIVE is TRUE before running 
	     estimate_layer_ice_content.  This avoids the problem of the 
	     soil layer ice content being set to a positive value, ignored
	     by the rest of the model.
	Vapor pressure: (Keith)
	     All internal vapor pressure calculations are now done in 
	     Pascals.  Previous release versions, switched between Pa
	     and kPa, so this simply removes the extra step.  The input
	     file format is unchanged, so there should be no change to
	     model output (model might run slightly faster, but it is
	     also unlikely that this will be witnessed by a normal user).
	Constant dew despite changing LAI: (Dave Peterson)
	     The modification of read_vegparam.c to update LAI based on 
	     a grid cell specific value did not change the values of Wdmax.  
	     Wdmax values were computed in read_veglib.c based on the 
	     default LAI values, so they did not necessarily reflect the 
	     actually LAI values used for the grid cell.  Values for Wdmax 
	     are now computed in read_vegparam.c whenever GLOBAL_LAI are 
	     provided.  The effects of this change will change in magnitude
	     based on how different the cell LAI values are from those in
	     the default library file.
	DRY_TIME error: (Reinur Schnur)
	     DRY_TIME in dist_prcp.c was incremented by the time step in 
	     hours.  Then to see if the current rain was part of the same 
	     storm or the start of a new one, DRY_TIME was checked to see 
	     if it was greater than or equal to 24/dt.  This compares 
	     DRY_TIME in hours to the model time step.  The "/dt" has been 
	     removed, so now DRY_TIME is checked versus the hours since the 
	     last storm.
	State file: (KAC)
	     *** WARNING: This may require modifications to your global file ***
	     The state file has been modified to account for model updates.
	     It has also been converted to write binary files - this makes 
	     them less convenient to edit, but means that model starts using
	     the same forcing, soil and vegetation files will produce the
	     exact same results.  There has also been a slight change in how
	     the global file is set up to restart the model.  The global
	     file should now have the same year, month, day and hour as the 
	     original global file - the VIC model will compute the number of
	     records to skip at the beginning to reach the point where the 
	     model state was saved.  This means that calculations to yield
	     sub-daily metrological forcings from daily forcings will produce 
	     the exact same forcing values -> this also means that restarted
	     simulations will be exactly the same as the original run.  Slight
	     variations in the model results were also introduced because the
	     method for storing soil node depths led to the possibility of 
	     very small differences in dz_node for the restarted model.  
	     Previous versions also did not store the snowpack cold content,
	     this meant that for restarts during winter, the snowpack albedo
	     might start on the ablation curve (as cold content was initialized
	     to 0 and not to a value less than 0) rather than the accumulation
	     curve.  This could lead to slight differences in the snowpack
	     if no new snow fell and the snowpack was not melting - but
	     after 10 years of simulations the differences were minor.  As 
	     noted above the new version of the state file should allow the
	     model to be restarted and to produce exactly the same results as
	     the original complete result.  If there are cases where this is
	     not true, please report.  If you edit the read/write model state
	     functions - BE VERY CAREFUL to edit Nbytes to reflect any changes.
	COMPUTE_TREELINE: (KAC and LCB)
	     This is an added feature which computes the treeline elevation
	     in the current grid cell and does not include vegetation 
	     fractions with overstory in the grid cell averages for snow bands
	     that exceed the treeline elevation.  This feature was added
	     to the model to reduce the appearance of "glaciers" in high
	     elevation snow bands.  It computes average annual July air
	     temperatures using the temperature data from the atmospheric
	     forcing files (WARNING - elevation of treeline may change if
	     the period of forcing data used changes).  It then lapses the
	     average annual July air temperature to locate the elevation 
	     at which it equals 10C.  This is assumed to be the treeline,
	     so vegetation types with overstory in snow bands with average 
	     elevations higher than this, are excluded from the grid cell
	     average variables in put_data.c.  For the time being full 
	     energy and water balances are still computed for these 
	     vegetation fractions, and no attempt is made to verify that
	     a snow band has a non-overstory vegetation type that can be 
	     expanded to represent the coverage area lost due to the 
	     exclusion of the overstory fraction.

August 15, 2000: VIC release 4.0.3

This release fixes a problem with the implementation of va_arg that 
causes run time errors on some systems.  Previous releases of the code 
worked correctly on the LINUX and freeBSD systems where it was tested. 
However on some systems (including Sun Ultra-2s) character variables 
passed with va_arg are changed into integers so reading a character from 
the argument list does not produce the value sent to the routine.  The
character flags used by VIC to indicate if there is snow present and if
the frozen soil algorithm has been activated have now been converted to 
integers, which should make the va_arg call work on all systems.

Also fixed in this release was a check in dist_prec.c to see if it is 
still raining which actually used the memory address of the 
precipitation variable rather than the daily value in the check.

MODIFIED FILES:
	read_atmos_data.c	-	Fixed input file time step check
	write_forcing_files.c	-	Added free statements for pointers
	calc_surf_energy_bal.c	-	Converted char flags to int
	dist_prec.c		-	Fixed logical statement error
	frozen_soil.c		-	Converted char flags to int
	func_surf_energy_bal.c	-	Converted char flags to int
	initialize_atmos.c	-	Added flag for output forcing
	vicNl.h			-	Converted char flags to int
	vicNl_def.h		-	Converted char flags to int

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

July 19, 2000: VIC release 4.0.2

Two new pre-processor options have been added to VIC as well as minor 
modifications to two subroutines.  

If set to TRUE the NO_REWIND pre-processor option stops the VIC model from
rewinding the soil and vegetation parameter input files for each new grid
cell.  This reduces run times but requires that all input files are in the
same order as the soil parameter file.  

If set TRUE the OUTPUT_FORCE pre-processor option blocks off the main
model and only reads the provided forcing files. Once VIC has estimated
the missing forcing parameters the full forcing data set for the defined
simulation period is output to a series of gridded forcing files.  The
gridded forcing files are written to the RESULTS directory defined in the
global control file with the prefix "full_data_".  The new files are in
Binary or ASCII depending on the setting of BINARY_OUTPUT.

The error messages in get_global_param.c have been modified so that the
correct file is referenced when telling the user to change values found in
the model source code.

In read_soilparam.c, the soil parameters are defined only if the current
grid cell is run, otherwise the line in the file is skipped and soil_con
is returned without new data values.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

May 30, 2000: VIC release 4.0.1

Increased use of the released VIC model code has lead to the
discovery of a couple of minor bugs.  This release fixes those bugs as
well as introducing a improved precipitation correction algorithm based on 
Yang et al. 1998.  Unless you have encountered these problems or are
trying to correct precipitation undercatch due to wind, in the VIC
model, your results will not be impacted by these fixes.

MODIFIED FILES:
    correct_precip.c       - changed to WMO correction equation for
                             NWS 8" standard gauge.
    full_energy.c          - modified to handle WMO correction.
    initialize_atmos.c     - modified to handle WMO correction.
                             fixed error in estimating minimum daily 
                             temperature from sub-daily temperatures.
    make_in_and_outfiles.c - removed line that opened the state file
                             again for each new grid cell.
    open_state_file.c      - modified comments.
    put_data.c             - modified to handle WMO correction.
    snow_utility.c         - cleaned source code.
    solve_snow.c           - modified to handle WMO correction.
    surface_fluxes.c       - modified to handle WMO correction.
    vicNl.h                - modified to handle WMO correction.
    vicNl_def.h            - modified to handle WMO correction.

Topic: Release of VIC 4.0.0

The code for VIC release 4.0.0 has undergone several months of tests (as
VIC release 3.3.0 Beta) and has now been deemed ready for release to the
general public.  This document is designed to provide information
concerning changes in the model between the last release version (3.2.1)
and the current version.

There is no formal users manual, information about how to use the current
version can be found at
http://www.hydro.washington.edu/Lettenmaier/Models/VIC/VIChome.html.  
Information about the basic model design can be found in Liang, et al.
(1994), while the rewrite of the source code as well as the addition of
cold season processes is described in Cherkauer and Lettenmaier (1999).

The VIC macroscale hydrologic model was developed as a research tool.  As
such it is the users responsibility to verify that it is working correctly
when applied to new situations.  When using the VIC model reference should
be made to Liang, et al. (1994) and Cherkauer and Lettenmaier (1999) as
well as an acknowledgment that the code was received from the University
of Washington.  Other important papers relating to the development of the
VIC model are included on the home page and in the source code.

Possible bugs in the code should be reported to
vicadmin@hydro.washington.edu.  ALWAYS CHECK YOUR INPUT FILES!  Most
"bugs" are actually caused by trying to run the model with bad parameters
or forcing data.  The VIC model will run limited checks to find common
major errors but in most cases it will attempt to run with the bad values.  
If after checking all of your input data you still believe you have found
a bug in the model, send an e-mail including the complete output from the
model as well as a description of the problem and the files necessary to
run the model to recreate the code (if files are large please put a
compressed tar file in
ftp://ftp.ce.washington.edu/pub/HYDRO/vicadmin/TEMP).  Outdated and
modified versions of the code are the responsibility of the user to debug.  
Modifications made to the code, which may improve the general model
performance, may be submitted to vicadmin@hydro.washington.edu for
possible inclusion in future versions of the code.

VIC release 4.0.0 represents a major change to the source code from
version 3.2.1.  It is strongly recommended that if you were using version
3.2.1 or earlier versions that you update with a complete copy of the new
code.

Major changes from release version 3.2.1 to 4.0.0:

- Radiation Estimation Update: The routines to estimate shortwave and
longwave radiation as well as vapor pressure from daily minimum and
maximum temperature and precipitation have been updated to correspond to
the algorithm described by Thornton and Running (1999).  These routines
provide significantly improved radiation estimates especially in regions
outside the continental United States.

- Model Core Update: The core of the VIC model was rewritten so that all
modes of the model (water balance, energy balance, etc.) make use of the
same model code.  This makes it easier to modify the model and have
modifications apply to sll modes, it also allows the model to run with new
combinations of algorithms (i.e. full energy balance mode with the finite
difference ground heat flux solution).

- Soil Moisture Transport Update: The frozen and thawed sub-layers added
to the model for the original frozen soil algorithm have been removed.  
This makes the soil drainage routine cleaner and faster.  Frozen soils now
estimate full layer ice contents from the ice content at each soil thermal
node.  Without being confined by sub-layers, the frozen soil algorithm can
now be applied to regions of permafrost.

- Forcing File Control Added: Version 4.0.0 moves controls of the forcing
file format and data types into the global control file.  The model can
now handle most ASCII column and short int Binary files without writing
new subroutines and recompiling the source code.

- Pre-processor Options Added: There are now more option flags in the
source code headers to control which parts of the model are in fact
compiled.  This allows the model functionality to be adjusted without the
addition of computationally intensive conditional switching statements.

- Model State File: With the release of version 4.0.0 separate snow and
soil initialization files have been combined into a single model state
file.  The state file can be created outside the model for starting
simulations with prescribed initial conditions, or the model state can be
saved by VIC at a specified date.  Note that currently there will be small
differences between a full and a warm started simulation because radiation
and vapor pressure are estimated using forcing data from the simulation
period, not from the full dataset included in the forcing file.  It also
does not store wet and dry fraction information, when running with
distributed precipitation the model is restarted using average soil
conditions.
