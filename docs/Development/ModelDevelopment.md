# Open Source

We encourage any users who have modified (or would like to modify) VIC, either to fix bugs or develop new features, to contact us and coordinate development work with us. The VIC model source code is archived in Git and is publicly available through [GitHub](https://github.com). To access the source code, visit [GitHub](https://github.com), create an account, and visit [github.com/UW-Hydro/VIC](https://github.com/UW-Hydro/VIC). The routing model will soon be added to the archive as well.

# Release Naming Convention

Beginning with the release of VIC 4.2, a release naming convention of VIC.MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH has been formally adopted. This naming system was introduced by [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) and defined as:

1.  MAJOR version: when changes are included that are not backward compatible,
2.  MINOR version: when features and new functionality are added in a backwards-compatible manner, and
3.  PATCH version: when backwards-compatible bug fixes are made.
