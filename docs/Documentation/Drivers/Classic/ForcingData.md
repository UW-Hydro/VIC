# VIC Forcings Files

The VIC Classic Driver requires subdaily forcings (meteorological or other). Forcing timestep must be the same as snow model timestep, which is specified by the `SNOW_STEPS_PER_DAY` parameter in the [Global Parameter File](GlobalParam.md). The required forcing variables and units are listed below and must also be specified in the [Global Parameter File](GlobalParam.md)

#### Meteorological Forcings, Required in all simulations:

| LAI_IN     | Leaf Area Index                                          | m<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> |
| VEGCOVER   | Partial veg cover fraction ( = 1 - canopy gap fraction ) | fraction (between 0 and 1)  |

#### Lake Forcings, Required when LAKES is TRUE:

| Variable   | Description                                              | Units           |

#### Carbon Cycle Forcings, Required when CARBON is TRUE:

| Variable   | Description                                   | Units           |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------- |
| CATM       | Atmospheric CO2 mixing ratio                  | ppm             |

| PAR        | Photosynthetically active radiation           | W/m<sup>2</sup> |

As of October 2015, work is currently underway to develop a next generation meteorological forcing generator. This work, in part, will support the development of VIC forcings.  Follow or contribute to the development of these tools by visiting https://github.com/jhamman/mtclim5.
