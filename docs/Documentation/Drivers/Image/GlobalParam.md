# VIC Run-Time Options - Global Parameter File

NOTE: this page is under development, and further details will be added shortly.

The global parameter file serves two main purposes:

1.  Tells VIC the names, locations, and formats of input and output files
2.  Defines global parameters of the simulation (known as _run-time_ options)

The order of the options in the global parameter file is not important, but the complete option name must be followed by the required option type information.
