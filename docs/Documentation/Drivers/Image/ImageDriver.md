# VIC Image Driver

!!! Warning
    The Image Driver is still in development and as a result, the documentation here may not be complete at this time.

The Image Driver represents the modern implementation of the VIC model.  It uses netCDF I/O, runs in a time-before-space evaluation order, and uses MPI for parallel processing.
