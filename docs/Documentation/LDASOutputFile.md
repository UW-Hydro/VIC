# LDAS Output File

The LDAS project output file format is designed to output a limited number of variables into the most compressed file format available. Most of the output variables are stored as short int values in a binary file. Short int values require only 2 bytes for storage but do not allow the range of values normally stored so most variables are modified by a constant before storage. Details of the file storage format are discussed on this page.

Each output file contains model output from one grid cell. The files use the naming convention "fluxes_xx.xx_yy.yy", where xx.xx is the latitude, and yy.yy is the longitude. The number of decimal places in the output filename is determined by GRID_DECIMAL in the [global parameter file](GlobalParam.md), while the latitude and longitude values come from the [soil parameter file](SoilParam.md).

## LDAS Output File

## Binary Format

Data is in an Binary column format. To make VIC output in this format, paste the contents of the file output.LDAS_OUTPUT.template, which is included with the VIC Source Code on the [download page](../SourceCode/Code.md), into the bottom of your [global parameter file](GlobalParam.md).
