# VIC NetCDF Tools

[NetCDF](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) is a machine-independent format for representing scientific data. It is widely used among the atmospheric sciences community and is quickly becoming a standard format for use in comparing outputs between different models.

Tools for converting between standard VIC input/output and NetCDF are under the "Post-processing" section of the [download page](../SourceCode/Code.md)
