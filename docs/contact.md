The [VIC listserve](https://mailman.u.washington.edu/mailman/listinfo/vic_users) should be used for questions about model setup and application. It is basically VIC users helping other VIC users.

All other exchanges about VIC source code are managed through the [VIC github page](https://github.com/UW-Hydro/VIC).
