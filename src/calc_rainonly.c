  calc_rainonly.c	Keith Cherkauer		March 7, 1998

  Determines from the air temperature what fraction of incoming
  precipitation is frozen and unfrozen (snow and rain).

  Modifications:
  09-22-98 Modified to filter out very small fractions of snow
           or rain in mixed precipitation.  Minimum value MIN_PREC
	   is adjusted to account for the size of mu (minimum
	   is based of fractional precipitation with mu=1, since
	   snow cannot be solved for when mu<1).                  KAC
  10-May-04 Changed test
		if ( MAX_SNOW_TEMP < MIN_RAIN_TEMP )
	    to
		if ( MAX_SNOW_TEMP <= MIN_RAIN_TEMP )
            to avoid possibility of dividing by zero.		TJB
  10-May-04 Changed test
		else if(air_temp > MAX_SNOW_TEMP)
	    to
		else if(air_temp >= MAX_SNOW_TEMP)
	    to fix situation in which, if air_temp = MAX_SNOW_TEMP,
	    rainfall (rainonly) was set to 0 and snowfall was set
	    to 100% of precip, causing function to fail.	TJB
  2007-Apr-04 Modified to handle grid cell errors by returning to the
           main subroutine, rather than ending the simulation.   GCT/KAC
  2014-Mar-28 Removed DIST_PRCP option.					TJB
