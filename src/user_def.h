/**********************************************************************
  This header file contains model parameters that can be modified by
  the user to control model performance.  When this file is modified 
  the model needs to be recompiled for the changes to take effect.

  NOTE (to those who add or remove parameters from VIC):
  Any additions or removals of parameters in this file must also
  be made in display_current_settings.c.

/***** If TRUE all energy balance calculations are iterated to minimize
       the total column (air, canopy, snow and ground) error.  Otherwise
       no iteration is used and the model estimates the new fluxes
       based on those from the previous time step, results should
       be similar, however, the model will report energy balance errors *****/
#define CLOSE_ENERGY FALSE

/***** If TRUE VIC uses a system of linear equations defined in global.h
       to estimate the maximum unfrozen water content equation.  This 
       significantly reduces the run time with frozen soil, but may
       introduce new errors (STILL UNDER TESTING, ALSO NEEDS DEBUGGING) *****/
#define QUICK_FS FALSE
#define QUICK_FS_TEMPS 7

/***** If TRUE VIC uses the linear interpolation of the logarithm of the
       matric potential from the two surrounding layers to estimate the 
       soil moisture drainage from each layer (Boone and Wetzel, 1996).
       This should improve the soil moisture drainage predicted by the
       low resolution solution computed by VIC. *****/
#define LOW_RES_MOIST FALSE


/***** If TRUE VIC does not rewind the vegetation, state, and snow
       band files before read data for each cell.  This saves time
       but requires that all grid cells are listed in the same
       order as the soil parameter file *****/

/***** If TRUE VIC reads the model forcing files, and creates the full
       internal forcing dataset (longwave, shortwave, humidity, etc.)
       which is then written to a series of gridded output files for
       later use.  Gridded forcing files are written to the RESULTS
       directory defined in the global control file, and are binary
       or ASCII based on the BINARY_OUTPUT flag. *****/
#define OUTPUT_FORCE FALSE

/***** If TRUE VIC computes the mean, standard deviation, and sum
       and finds the minimum and maximum values of the forcing 
       variables for each grid cell and outputs the results to 
       stdout.  These values are meant to be a quick check for
       obvious errors in the forcing data, more thorough checks 
       of the data should be conducted outside of the model by the 
       user. *****/

/***** If TRUE VIC allows for excess ground ice, i.e. an expanded porosity
       to account for an initial volumetric ice fraction larger than
       soil porosity.  The porosity decreases as the excess ice melts.  
       Once porosity reaches the soil porosity (1-bulk density/soil density), 
       it does not change.  Initial volumetric ice fraction must be

/***** Number of iterations to use in solving the surface energy balance.
