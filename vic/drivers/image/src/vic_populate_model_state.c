/******************************************************************************
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * This function populates the model state.
 *
 * If a state file is provided to the model then its contents are checked
 * to see if it agrees with the current simulation set-up, if so it is used
 * to initialize the model state.  If no state file is provided then the
 * model initializes all variables with defaults and the user should expect
 * to throw out the beginning of the simulation period as model spin-up.
