# Python Driver Readme

### Requirements
- [CFFI](http://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) version 1.2 or greater

### Installing
run `python setup.py install` from the `vic/drivers/python` directory.

### Usage
```python
import vic.lib as vic_lib

vic_lib.print_license()
```

### Generating headers for cffi
The header information in `vic_headers.py` was manually generated by following these steps:
- `gcc -std=c99 -E -P src/globals.c -I./include/ -I../shared/include/ -I../../vic_run/include/ > header.txt`
- manually removing system declarations and VIC specific declarations using the `va_args` syntax.
